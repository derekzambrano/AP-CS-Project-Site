    <h2> Custom Final Game</h2>
    <p><a href= "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326667915/"> Try it out!</a></p>
    <p>A two-player game in which one player is the chaser that is controlled by the mouse, (the green drone), and the other player is the runner that is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard, (the blue drone). The runner must stay away from the chaser for as long as they can, and each time they recieve will be displayed for a brief moment after they get caught. The highest score or longest time without being caught is recorded in the top right. If you're the runner, try to beat it, if you're the chaser, try to get the job done quick. Regardless, go out and have fun with this cool PvP space matchup!<p></p>

        <h2> Mandala Snap Project</h2>
        <p><a href= "https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=derekzambrano&ProjectName=Derek%20%26%20Alia%20U2L2%20Mandala"> Try it out!</a></p>
        <p> A Snap coded Lab Project in which multiple blocks such as a polygon block are used to alter the number of lines and vertices as well as a collection of other variables so that when the user clicks the space bar, a mandala figure is drawn. This octagon is very pleasing and complex to the eye and it is very interesting to watch the live code come to life! <p></p>
