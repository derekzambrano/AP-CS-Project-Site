    <h2> Custom Final Scratch Game</h2>
    <p><a href= "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326667915/"> Try it out!</a></p>
    <p>A two-player Scratch game in which one player is the chaser that is controlled by the mouse, (the green drone), and the other player is the runner that is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard, (the blue drone). The runner must stay away from the chaser for as long as they can, and each time they recieve will be displayed for a brief moment after they get caught. The highest score or longest time without being caught is recorded in the top right. If you're the runner, try to beat it, if you're the chaser, try to get the job done quick. Regardless, go out and have fun with this cool PvP space matchup! I had trouble making the different speeds fair and tried to balance it out with the controls for each user. I learned a lot about what makes up a simple arcade type game, and even used some other similar games as ideas to create my own project!<p></p>

        <h2> Mandala Snap Project</h2>
        <p><a href= "https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=derekzambrano&ProjectName=Derek%20%26%20Alia%20U2L2%20Mandala"> Try it out!</a></p>
        <p> A Snap coded lab project in which multiple blocks such as a polygon block are used to alter the number of lines and vertices as well as a collection of other variables so that when the user clicks the space bar, a mandala figure is drawn. This polygon is very pleasing and complex to the eye and it is very interesting to watch the live code come to life! We followed step-by-step instructions within SNAP! which made it an overall smooth process. There weren't really any challenges but I did learn about what internally makes up a mandala figure. <p></p>

    <h2> Snap Drawing App</h2>
    <p><a href= "https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=derekzambrano&ProjectName=Derek%20and%20Alia%20Drawing%20App"> Try it out!</a></p>
    <p> A Snap coded drawing app designed to have various learning functions for an audience of young middle schoolers ran almost entirely off of user inputs. Teaching along the lines of area, polygons, and angles, clear instructions and a straight-forward user interface make the app overall very easy to navigate and simple for all use. Using formulas to calculate different operations within the app was a slight challenge but in the end we figured it out and even submitted the app to the Congressional App Challenge. Learning along the way off of various websites and youtube tutorials I ended up learning a lot about what type of code makes up a simple yet useful drawing app.<p></p>
